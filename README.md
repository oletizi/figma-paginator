# Figma Paginator

I don't recommend using Figma for multi-page documents that need page numbers&mdash;it's really not built for 
that&mdash;but if you *must*, this might add page numbers to each frame if:
* The frame has a component named "PAGE NUMBER COMPONENT"
* That component's first child is a text node that can be updated to contain the page number

Again, I don't recommend using Figma for this purpose.
